   - Runs weekly to check for new Azure icons from Microsoft
   - Downloads and compares with current icons
   - Updates the repository and triggers deployment if changes are detected

2. **GitHub Pages Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`):
   - Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on pushes to main branch
   - Rebuilds the icon index and React app
   - Serves the app at the GitHub Pages URL
